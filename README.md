# Heart-Disease-Detector-Project
## Problem Statement

Heart disease remains a leading global cause of death, especially in low-resource regions lacking early diagnostic tools. Existing clinical methods are often manual, subjective, and inaccessible. This project develops a machine learning model to predict heart disease using patient clinical data. It aims to support early detection and improve diagnostic efficiency in underserved healthcare systems.

## Objectives

- **Improve Diagnosis Accuracy**: Utilize AI algorithms to analyze patient data and identify potential heart disease indicators with higher precision than traditional methods.
- **Speed Up Diagnosis Process**: Reduce the time required for diagnosis by automating data analysis, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on patient care.

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Generate actionable insights from large datasets, helping to inform treatment decisions and preventive measures.
