# Heart-Disease-Detector-Project
## Problem Statement

Heart disease remains a leading global cause of death, especially in low-resource regions lacking early diagnostic tools. Existing clinical methods are often manual, subjective, and inaccessible. This project develops a machine learning model to predict heart disease using patient clinical data. It aims to support early detection and improve diagnostic efficiency in underserved healthcare systems.
